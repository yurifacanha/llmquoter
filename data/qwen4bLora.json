But his play picked up as the spring ended, eliciting this comment from defensive coordinator Dan Quinn: “At Texas, we thought he had a good get-off and had speed to use that length. For him, he’s been one of those guys that we talked about earlier, the speed in the practices has really helped him get in good shape. He’s jumped out to me as a pass rusher first.
