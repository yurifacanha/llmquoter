You can take time off work to accompany your wife and newborn. Fathers are entitled to government-paid paternity leave for all births if you fulfil the eligibility criteria:\n- Your baby is a Singapore citizen\n- You’re lawfully-married to your baby’s mother between conception and birth\n- You’ve been with your employer for a continuous period of at least three months before the birth of your baby.\n## Whether you’re working or staying home, both your wife and yourself should expect sleepless nights. Most babies don’t start sleeping through the night until they are about three months old.\n\n## The confinement period\nWith all these changes, the four to six week period right after childbirth is especially important for both mummy and baby.\n## In Western cultures, the confinement period is referred to as ‘lying-in’ as it requires a long period of bedrest during and after pregnancy even if there were no medical complications during childbirth.\n\n## In Asian cultures, emphasis is placed on diet. As a general rule of thumb, traditional Chinese, Malay and Indian confinement practices emphasise the consumption of ‘warming’ foods and beverages.\n## What You Should Avoid\nActing like nothing has changed\n## Do not act as though nothing has changed. Simple right?\n## Postpone your boys nights to clubs or pubs.\n## Forget about late-nights watching EPL or UFC matches live.\n\n## Trying to ‘fix’ your wife\nDon’t be solution-focused or try to ‘fix’ her. Birth brings about many changes to a mother, but in no way should you treat her as though anything needs to be ‘fixed’. Instead, focus on helping her recover healthy and supporting her throughout.\n## Don’t treat her as though nothing has changed.\n\n## What You Can Do\nThrow Her A Baby Shower\n## Another milestone that has become popular among young Singaporean parents is their baby’s 100 Day birthday. Having a 100 Day instead of a Full Month celebration gives you more time to prepare and more time for your wife to recover.\n## As Dr Christopher Ng, gynaecology specialist at GynaeMD Clinic, points out, new mums may face issues such as breast engorgement, pain from a C-section wound, urinary incontinence and haemorrhoids.\n\n## Whether your family prefers an elaborate themed party or intimate gathering over a meal, it might be best to wait until your wife has recovered and is ready.\n## Plan surprise parties at your own risk!\n## Engage A Confinement Caterer\n## Eating right is crucial for a smooth confinement period. Consuming the right herbs, soups and teas will make a difference in your wife’s postpartum recovery.\n\n## Can’t cook and don’t have time to research recipes? Confinement catering services are available.\n## Postpartum meal services are usually priced as single-meal (lunch or dinner) or dual-meal (lunch and dinner) packages lasting from one week to twenty-eight days.",

The earliest stone tools were recovered from modern Ethiopia and were dated to between two-million and three-million years old.  The archaeological record of lithic technology is divided into three major time periods: the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age).  Not all cultures in all parts of the world exhibit the same pattern of lithic technological development, and stone tool technology continues to be used to this day, but these three time periods represent the span of the archaeological record when lithic technology was paramount.  By analysing modern stone tool usage within an ethnoarchaeological context insight into the breadth of factors influencing lithic technologies in general may be studied.  See: Stone tool.  For example, for the Gamo of Southern Ethiopia, political, environmental, and social factors influence the patterns of technology variation in different subgroups of the Gamo culture; through understanding the relationship between these different factors in a modern context, archaeologists can better understand the ways that these factors could have shaped the technological variation that is present in the archaeological record.\n##end_quote## for each quote.\n\n\n##begin_quote##\nSweethead is an American alternative rock group formed in 2008.

A short term moving average is faster because it only considers prices over short period of time and is thus more reactive to daily price changes.
